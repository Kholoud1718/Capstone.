 **Automated Scan Controller**:

### Step 1: Create the README.md File

Open your terminal in the projectâ€™s main directory, then use this command:
```bash
echo "# Automated Scan Controller" > README.md
```

This will create a `README.md` file with an initial title. You can then open it in Visual Studio Code or your preferred text editor to add detailed content.

---

### Step 2: Populate README.md with Project Details

Here's a template for your README content. Update each section with your project-specific information.

```markdown
# Automated Scan Controller

A React and Java-based application for scheduling and performing automated security scans. This project integrates with ZAP (OWASP Zed Attack Proxy) to initiate instant scans, schedule future scans, and view vulnerabilities through a user-friendly dashboard.

## Features

1. **Instant Scan**: Initiate an immediate scan for a specified URL.
2. **Scheduled Scans**: Schedule scans to run periodically, such as daily, weekly, or monthly.
3. **Dashboard**: Visualize vulnerabilities with detailed charts and tables.
4. **Export Capabilities**: Export vulnerabilities data as PDF or CSV for reporting.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **npm** (for the frontend)
- **Java JDK** (for the backend)
- **ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)** configured locally or remotely

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the backend folder and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ./gradlew build
     ```

3. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the frontend folder and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     npm start
     ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Start both the backend and frontend. By default:
     - Frontend will be on `http://localhost:3000`
     - Backend will be on `http://localhost:4567`
     - ZAP will be on `http://localhost:8080`

## API Endpoints

### 1. **Instant Scan**
   - **Endpoint**: `POST /api/instant-scan`
   - **Purpose**: Trigger an immediate scan.
   - **Parameters**: 
     - `url`: URL to be scanned.
     - `scanType`: Type of scan (e.g., Passive, Spider).
   - **Response**: Returns scan initiation confirmation.

### 2. **Scheduled Scan**
   - **Endpoint**: `POST /api/schedule-scan`
   - **Purpose**: Schedule a future scan.
   - **Parameters**: 
     - `url`, `interval`, `day`, `time`, `script`, etc.
   - **Response**: Confirmation of scan scheduling.

### 3. **Retrieve Vulnerabilities**
   - **Endpoint**: `GET /api/vulnerabilities`
   - **Purpose**: Retrieve vulnerability results.
   - **Response**: JSON array of vulnerability details.

## Architecture Overview

- **Frontend**: Built with React, using `react-router` for navigation. It includes components like **Scheduler** and **Dashboard**.
- **Backend**: A Java application powered by Spark Framework, interacting with the ZAP API for scans and storing scheduled tasks in memory.
- **Database**: Currently, there is no database. Future enhancements could integrate one to store scan history.

---

## Frontend

The frontend is built with React and includes the following components:

1. **App Component** (`App.js`): Handles the main logic for instant and scheduled scans.
2. **Dashboard Component** (`Dashboard.js`): Displays vulnerability data using charts and tables.

### Key Features in Dashboard

- **Charts**: Uses `react-chartjs-2` to visualize vulnerability data.
- **Export Options**: Allows exporting data as PDF and CSV using `jsPDF` and `jspdf-autotable`.


## Backend

The backend is implemented in Java with Spark Framework and includes core classes:

1. **App.java**: Initializes routes and API endpoints.
2. **ZapService.java**: Manages interaction with ZAP API for initiating and managing scans.

### Key Backend Features

- **API Endpoints**: Supports `/api/instant-scan`, `/api/schedule-scan`, and `/api/vulnerabilities`.
- **ZAP Integration**: Configured to initiate different types of scans based on ZAP API.

---

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Dependencies**: Relies on ZAP for scanning. Any ZAP limitations may impact functionality.
2. **Data Persistence**: Currently in-memory; a database could improve data storage for production.
3. **API Key Management**: Ensure secure handling of ZAP API keys to prevent unauthorized access.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Database Integration**: Store scan history and detailed vulnerability data.
- **User Authentication**: Add user login functionality to restrict access to the dashboard.
- **Notification System**: Send email alerts when critical vulnerabilities are detected.
- **Customizable Reports**: Allow users to generate custom reports based on scan results.
